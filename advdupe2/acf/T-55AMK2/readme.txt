Step by step installation since there are some who don't know how to install advdupe2 files

Open the folder
Take the .txt file
Put it into [storagethingyletterhere]:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\advdupe2\[any folder of your choosing]
Open it lol
Now that you've done this, you can do it with any other kind of advdupe2 vehicle
