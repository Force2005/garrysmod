This is a pre-release version of the Javelin I showcased in the video.
It's currently very incomplete and needs a lot of fine tuning and adjustment (primarily to prevent the missile from losing guidance during sharp turns and to improve the lead).
It is basically functional against vehicles, but somewhat unreliable.
You will need EGP Extras to get the HUD working properly.

To Use:
-Spawn dupe, link to EGP Hud Emitter.
-Equip Remote Control.
-Right click aims down sights (being out of sights for a while will clear your last target).
-Shift toggles zoom level.
-Alt changes fire mode (top attack vs direct attack).
-Left click fires (wait for a solid lock tone before you fire).
-Putting away the remote control will store the missile on your back again.

Before you ask, no I will not fix it to make it work with your particular server/modset/playstyle. 
This is released purely for instructional purposes. Don't be a dick with it and remember to play fair in ACF - if you wouldn't be having fun getting shot with this, the other guy probably wont either.
